# file-tree
A file tree viewer with user input. You can click on the folders as they dropown and display files / sub-folders or hide them. Use link below to see working website.
<code>https://c-l.dev/projects/file-tree</code>
or
<code>https://cal-dev-lab.github.io/file-tree</code>

This also allows a visitor to input their name into a prompt thus changing the title of the <code>h1</code> tag. I have also incorporated 2 secrets somewhere for you to find (without looking at the source code).
